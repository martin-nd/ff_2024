# Introduction

This is a live report / readme of my data driven fantasy football project. Each post here will detail some of the work that I've done in the past week ont this project, or some relevant update (draft / trades / model breakthroughs / etc). If you're following this feel free to check back every few weeks and see what progress I've made, or check back a day or two after a game and see what the results mean for my models.

This is my first attempt at doing sports analytics, and my sport growing up was swimming, so I'm extremely unfamiliar with both sports data and football in particular, but I'm hoping that what I lack in game knowledge, I make up for in mathematics and coding expertise. I guess we'll see.
